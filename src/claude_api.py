{taxonomy_doc}

{packaging_doc}

Product to analyze:
- Title: {title}
- Description: {body_html}{dimensions_info}{current_weight_info}

INSTRUCTIONS:

**STEP 1: TAXONOMY ASSIGNMENT**
Analyze the product and assign to Department, Category, and Subcategory from taxonomy above.

**STEP 2: PURCHASE OPTIONS**
Based on the assigned taxonomy category/subcategory, determine which purchase options apply (see taxonomy document for mappings).
Purchase options are CATEGORY-DRIVEN, not size or weight dependent.
- Option 1: Delivery (standard shipping)
- Option 2: Store Pickup
- Option 3: Local Delivery (within service area)
- Option 4: White Glove Delivery (premium items)
- Option 5: Customer Pickup Only (hay, bulk items)

**STEP 3: WEIGHT ESTIMATION**
Calculate weight based on whether the product is shipped:

**FIRST: Determine if product is shipped**
- Product IS SHIPPED if option 1 (Delivery) is in purchase_options
- Product is NOT SHIPPED if option 1 is NOT in purchase_options

**IF PRODUCT IS NOT SHIPPED:**

   **Case A: Has existing weight (current weight > 0)**
   - Use the existing variant weight as-is (no packaging added)
   - final_shipping_weight = current weight
   - confidence = "high"
   - source = "variant_weight_no_shipping"
   - reasoning = "Product not shipped, using existing weight without packaging"

   **Case B: No existing weight (current weight = 0)**
   - Calculate/estimate product weight using priorities below (B → C → D)
   - Add ONLY product packaging weight (NO shipping packaging)
   - weight = product_weight + product_packaging (NO shipping_packaging, NO 10% margin)
   - final_shipping_weight = weight
   - source = "extracted_from_text_no_shipping" or "calculated_from_dimensions_no_shipping" or "estimated_no_shipping"
   - reasoning = "Product not shipped, calculated weight includes product packaging only (no shipping packaging)"

**IF PRODUCT IS SHIPPED (option 1 in purchase_options):**

   Calculate conservative shipping weight using this EXACT PRIORITY ORDER:

   **PRIORITY A: Use existing variant.weight if available (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
      - If current weight > 0:
        * product_weight = current weight
        * Apply packaging rules from table above
        * shipping_weight = product_weight + product_packaging + shipping_packaging
        * confidence = "high"
        * source = "variant_weight"

   **PRIORITY B: Extract from text (SECOND PRIORITY)**
      - If weight is mentioned in title/description:
        * Extract weight: "50 lb bag", "25 lbs", "3 oz can"
        * Handle liquid conversions:
          - "5 gallon sealer" → detect material type → convert to lbs
          - "32 fl oz fertilizer" → detect material type → convert to lbs
        * product_weight = extracted/converted weight
        * Apply packaging rules from table above
        * shipping_weight = product_weight + product_packaging + shipping_packaging
        * confidence = "high"
        * source = "extracted_from_text"

   **PRIORITY C: Calculate from dimensions (THIRD PRIORITY, for hardscape products only)**
      - If dimensions are provided (for concrete/hardscape products):
        * Calculate volume in cubic feet: (length_in × width_in × thickness_in) / 1728
        * Estimate product_weight:
          - Concrete/pavers: volume × 150 lbs/ft³
          - Natural stone: volume × 165 lbs/ft³
        * Apply packaging rules from table above
        * shipping_weight = product_weight + product_packaging + shipping_packaging
        * confidence = "high"
        * source = "calculated_from_dimensions"

   **PRIORITY D: Estimate based on context (LOWEST PRIORITY, last resort)**
      - If none of the above available:
        * Estimate based on product type, description, and category context
        * Use comparable products as reference
        * Be CONSERVATIVE (round up)
        * Apply packaging rules from table above
        * shipping_weight = estimated_product_weight + product_packaging + shipping_packaging
        * confidence = "medium" or "low" (use "low" if very uncertain)
        * source = "estimated"

   **CRITICAL WEIGHT RULES (for shipped products only):**
   - Always round UP to nearest 0.5 lb
   - Be conservative - underestimating costs us money
   - Apply 10% safety margin to final weight: final_shipping_weight = shipping_weight × 1.10

**STEP 4: NEEDS REVIEW FLAG**
Set needs_review = true if:
- Weight confidence is "low"
- Product is unusual or doesn't fit standard categories
- Insufficient information to make confident estimates
